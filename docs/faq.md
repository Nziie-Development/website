## Music Commands

### Do you make music commands?
The simple answer is, <u>**no**</u>. 
### Why don't you make music commands?
I don't make music commands because it uses a 3rd party API from either YouTube (which is banned) and/or Spotify. I don't like using Spotify because I just don't like their API. I would love to use YouTube for music commands. But **most music bots were cancelled** because YouTube took action against Discord bots. Long story short, I will **NEVER** make music commands and never have. So sorry, **you will have to use a public bot for that** - since they're risking their project only to (possibly) get shutdown in the future by that music company.

## 3rd Party APIs
I don't like using third party APIs for Discord Bots. The reason for this is because 3rd party APIs can be very **glitchy** and **unstable**. 3rd party APIs can be useful for **meme commands**, **dog/cat commands**, and more commands that pull something from the internet. However, I just don't use them. Sorry.

## Refunds

### Can I get a refund?
No, **I don't give refunds under any normal circumstance.** Since hosting costs money, you can't "refund" hosting. So if you make a payment for a quartly period (3 months), it's permanent. I don't give refunds for a server shutting down or a "I don't need the bot anymore" circumstance. If you'd like to cancel your plan, you can do so in the PingHost client panel. When you do this, please contact me on my [Discord Server](/discord.html) and your bot will be deleted. The source code for your bot will be stored on my pc for **7 days** then deleted - so if you purchase a tier again within 7 days, it's a little bit less work for me.

## Source Code

### Do you give source code?
**No**, I don't give source code to **anyone** under **ANY circumstances**. You will never get source code for your bot. The reason for this is because I don't know what you're going to do with that code. You may sell it to someone else or not even give me credit for something **I made**. 


## Requested Features
### Why was my requested feature denied?
The feature you requested to be added to your bot(s) may have been denied for the following reasons:
  - Feature is to complicated
  - Feature uses too much resources (e.g. database storage, RAM, etc.)
  - Feature isn't something I do - may be comparable to [music commands](#music-commands) or uses [3rd party APIs](#3rd-party-apis)
